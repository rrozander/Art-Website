# Art-Website
### A Dynamic Art Portfolio Website

This website was created for an undergraduate art student to display various projects online. It is built as a dynamic website so the 
student can easily add, delete, and edit displayed information. This was achieved using the DJango framework as it allowed a simple interface to store 
objects onto a database. This was my first website I've bulit using Django.
